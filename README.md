## My process
First i got style declarations into the html-document by using :root-Variables for the colors.
Defining Font via embed Google Font Outline in Head and defining body-tag for font-family and classes for regular and bold.

After then i building the structure of the body:
div with id "container" to catch Image, H1 and Paragraph
Embedding QR-Code-Image with img-tag
Writing H1
Writing p
Styling container with white background, aligning with flexbox.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow



### What I learned

I'm working a lot with wordpress and Enfold-Theme. So it is useful to see, that development from scratch not as easy as it often looks, when i only read code on instagram. I thankful for the beginning of this journey to become a real developer.


### Continued development

Flexbox is always a riddle. More practice there will be useful for the future.
Media Queries are always the same.

### Useful resources

- [Flexbox Guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/#aa-background) - This helped me to unterstand how i can display various containers on the website
- [W3 schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_mediaqueries_ex.asp) - Always a good resource to understand html and css :-)
